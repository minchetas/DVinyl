## Quick Start (Docker)

The fastest way to run DVinyl is using the pre-built Docker image. You only need a `docker-compose.yml` and a `.env` file.

1. **Create a `docker-compose.yml`** (see [Docker Deployment Guide](./docs/docker.md) for the full file).
2. **Setup your environment variables** in a `.env` file (go check how to get your [api keys](./docs/api-keys.md)).
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3099`.
